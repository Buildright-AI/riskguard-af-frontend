Summary of PDF-related Issues in Verba

There are several open and closed issues related to PDF files in the Verba project.

One issue reports a timeout error when uploading large PDF files, suggesting a need to adjust timeout settings.

Another reports a failure during import of a PDF file due to batch vectorization issues.

A feature request suggests adding native support for PDF files, including displaying them in the UI with highlighted sections, to avoid losing formatting and images when converting them to text.

One user reported issues loading any text or PDF files using SimpleReader or PDFReader, encountering a 'store is read-only' error.

Additionally, a critical vulnerability was identified in React PDF, a dependency used by Verba, which needs to be addressed to ensure the project's security.
