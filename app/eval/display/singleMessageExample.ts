I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing with 'verba'. I understand how frustrating it must be, especially after following the instructions carefully.\n\nCould you please confirm that you are indeed working within the Python 3.10.5 environment? Sometimes, there are conflicts with packages from previous installations. We suggest checking your environment before proceeding with further troubleshooting.\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nKind regards,\nKaladin",
